plugin for CudaText.
when active, it changes vertical scroll position, so that line 
with caret is always centered in the editor window.

plugin gives 2 commands in the menu Plugins - Auto Center Line:
- Activate (you must call it for plugin to work)
- Deactivate
plugin is not activated on CudaText restart.
plugin is passive when multi-carets are placed.
